### Working paper

:(fas fa-layer-group fa-fw): **Majority voting or dictatorship? How collective-choice rules affect institutional design and cooperation**, with Eline van der Heijden

Collective-choice rules, e.g., majority voting or dictatorship, aggregate individual choices into a collective decision. This study provides experimental evidence on how collective-choice rules affect institutional design and cooperation behavior in a social dilemma.

Collective-choice rules aggregate individual choices into a collective choice. This experimental study addresses the role of collective-choice rules in self-governance via institutional design in a social dilemma. Groups decide repeatedly on whether to establish any institution, and if so which institutions, to sustain cooperation in a public goods game. We hypothesize that collective-choice rules may directly affect cooperation, conditional on having the same institutions. They may also have an indirect effect on cooperation, via institutional choices. We implement three collective-choice rules: majority voting, dictatorship and rotating dictatorship. Our main findings are: (1) cooperation level is not higher under the institutions chosen via a democratic rule than when the same institutions are chosen via a non-democratic rule. (2) Institutional choices made via majority voting or a fixed dictator are more stable over time than those chosen by rotating dictators. (3) The instability of institutions is associated with lower cooperation level. These results have implications for the organization of small-scale group-decision.

:(fas fa-layer-group fa-fw): **The persistent impact of biased narratives: Evidence from an online experiment**, with [Sili Zhang](www.silizhang.com)

People are swayed by biased narratives, even if they know the bias and the random allocation of these biased narratives. Further consumption of information does not help.

{{< version 0.2.10 >}}

Can people counteract biased narratives---the qualitative interpretation of objective facts or events---through subsequent information acquisition? Using an online experiment, we investigate this question by first randomly assigning participants to read different narratives that contain the same facts, and then offering them the opportunity to acquire more balanced arguments. We document three main findings. First, participants shift their attitudes towards the standpoint of the randomly assigned narrative, knowing that the narrative is biased and randomly assigned. Second, the opportunity to read additional arguments does not prompt participants to adjust their attitudes shaped by the original narrative. Third, when evaluating subsequent arguments, participants see arguments aligned with the randomly assigned narrative as more convincing, which likely contributes to their inability to counteract biased narratives. Taken together, our results demonstrate a persistent effect of biased narratives in a setting where counteracting is given the best chance.

:(fas fa-layer-group fa-fw): **The relativity of moral judgments**

People punish a decision maker who chooses an immoral action more harshly when such action is contrasted with a moral one. But they do not award moral behavior simply because it is contrasted with an immoral one...

{{< admonition abstract "Abstract" false >}}
{{< version 0.2.10 >}}

Moral judgments are important factors in individual decision-making and interpersonal interactions. I examine the relativity of moral judgments, specifically, whether moral judgments toward a decision maker depend on the reference decision maker’s choice. The results of an experiment show that people punish a decision maker who chooses an immoral action more harshly when they observe another moral choice than if they observe another immoral one. A contrast effect, rather than a shift in perceived social norms, accounts for the relativity. The relativity of moral judgments suggests that there exists non-monetary spillover effects of one's action on another. The results have implications for moral behavior in markets and in other social contexts.

### Work in progress

:(fas fa-layer-group fa-fw): **Mistakes or misbeliefs? Decomposing strategic naivety about undisclosed information**, with [Tingting Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/tingtingwuecon/home)

No news is bad news? Theories say so, because otherwise it wouldn't be withheld. But people in our study behave naively as if no news means no news. They struggle with diagnostic reasoning and Bayes' updating, and also hold incorrect beliefs about their opponents.

:(fas fa-layer-group fa-fw): **When to feed the Leviathan: Trading-off between efficiency, fairness, and the intrinsic value of power**, with Yadi Yang

In times of crisis, are people willing to opt for external intervention--a centralized institution that coerces cooperation? This depends on their beliefs about others' behavior and their own preferences and values.
